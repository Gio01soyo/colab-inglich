        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! We are [Team Name] and this is my English IV final project. I will talk about my favorite anime, My Hero Academia, and show how it connects to my hobbies, my daily life, and my plans for the future. You will see how I used grammar structures from English IV—like present simple, past simple, used to, and passive voice—in every section.</p>

        <h2>My Hobbies and Free Time</h2>
        <p>We love watching My Hero Academia in our free time. We usually stream two episodes each weekend and participate in an online fan community where new theories are shared. Besides anime, some team members play football together, while others enjoy drawing fan art of characters like Midoriya and All Might. We used to play video games as our main hobby when we were younger, but now we spend more time discussing plot developments and creating cosplay ideas.</p>

        <h2>Past Experiences</h2>
        <p>Last year, we discovered My Hero Academia because some members of our team recommended it to the rest. We were used to watching only Western cartoons, so we were all surprised by the Japanese animation style. We remember that many of our weekends were spent reading the manga together, and we even attended our first cosplay event as a group. The experience was unforgettable because we met other fans who inspired us and strengthened our teamwork.</p>

        <h2>My Daily Routine</h2>
        <p>On weekdays, we wake up early and check if a new episode of My Hero Academia has been released. Some of us go to school or work from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., and afterwards we review our English IV notes together. In the evenings, we do our homework and then stream one episode before our group study session. Watching My Hero Academia helps us relax, and we often pause to take notes on interesting character interactions and discuss them over chat.</p>
